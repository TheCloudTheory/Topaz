# Supported services
Depending on the version of Topaz a different set of Azure services is supported for emulation. The table below presents the current state of emulation and maturity of certain features.

:::tip[Best practice]

Make sure you're using the most recent version of Topaz to benefit from the bugfixes and newest features.

:::tip[Looking for a detailed breakdown?]

The [API Coverage](../api-coverage/container-registry) section lists every REST operation for each service and shows exactly which ones are implemented in Topaz. Coverage for Subscriptions and Resource Groups is tracked under the [Azure Resource Manager](../api-coverage/resource-manager) page.

## Used ports
The ports used by Topaz can be divided into two groups:
* common port for Azure Resource Manager operations
* service-specific port for data plane

You can find which service uses which port below:
Service Name|Port|Protocol
------------|----|--------
Resource Manager|8899, 443|HTTPS
Table Storage|8890|HTTPS
Blob Storage|8891|HTTPS
Queue Storage|8893|HTTPS
Azure Key Vault|8898, 443|HTTPS
Azure Event Hub|8897|HTTPS
Azure Event Hub (AMQP)|8888|AMQP
Azure Service Bus|8887, 8899|HTTPS
Azure Service Bus (AMQP)|8889, 5671|AMQP, AMQP/TLS
Container Registry (control plane)|8899|HTTPS
Container Registry (data plane)|8892|HTTPS

For HTTPS endpoints, if you're running Topaz as a standalone application, you need to install and trust the certificates provided along with the main package.

:::warning[Admin privileges required for port 443]

Port 443 is a privileged port on Linux and macOS. If you are running Topaz as a **standalone executable** (not inside a container) and you need Azure CLI integration with Key Vault, you must start Topaz with `sudo` (or equivalent elevated privileges) so it can bind to port 443.

This requirement does **not** apply when running Topaz as a Docker container — Docker handles the privileged port mapping automatically.

If you are only using the Azure SDK (not the Azure CLI), you can point your SDK client directly at port 8898 and skip port 443 entirely.

## Ready to try it?

Get Topaz running in minutes — no account or registration needed.

```bash
brew install topaz
```

Or pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull thecloudtheory/topaz-host:latest
```

See the [Getting Started guide](/docs/intro) for full setup instructions, including certificate installation and Azure CLI integration.

:::tip[Missing a service?]

If a service you need isn't listed above or the coverage isn't deep enough for your use case, [open a GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/TheCloudTheory/Topaz/discussions) — your workflow will directly influence what gets built next.
