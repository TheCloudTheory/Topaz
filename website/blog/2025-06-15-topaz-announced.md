After giving it some initial dry runs and validating the overall concept, Topaz has been publicly announced. 

<!-- truncate -->

Topaz is an emulator for Microsoft Azure dedicated for developers and cloud engineers to help them with tests, lower overall infrastructure cost and decouple local environments from Azure. It doesn't require installing additional software, modifying network settings or setting up proxies. Just download the executable, run it and enjoy working with Azure like it was installed locally.
