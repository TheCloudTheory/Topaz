# Azure CLI integration

Topaz offers a seamless integration with Azure CLI by exposing a dedicated cloud environment which you can add locally with just a few steps. Follow this guide for more details.

## Trusting the certificate
As Topaz exposes HTTPS endpoints using a self-signed certificate, Azure CLI may fail when connecting to it because it's not part of the CA bundle certificate file which it uses. If you face an error such as:
```bash
Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
```
Please follow the [instruction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/cli/azure/use-azure-cli-successfully-troubleshooting?view=azure-cli-latest#work-behind-a-proxy) which explains how to use a self-signed certificate locally.

## Starting the emulator
Azure CLI requires you to authenticate against a real tenant before you can use the selected cloud environment. It will also try to obtain the metadata endpoints from it. To ensure the process goes smoothly, you will need to run the emulator in the background and include `--tenant-id` option:
```bash
$ topaz start --tenant-id <tenant-id>
```
It's important to remember that `--tenant-id` value must be an identifier of a tenant, where you have an account. 

:::tip[Best practice]

It's a good idea to create a dummy Microsoft Entra ID tenant so no additional security patterns are applied when signing-in (for instance Conditional Access). On the other hand using a real tenant may be helpful if you do want to implement E2E tests. Either option will work.

Keep the emulator running in the background and continue with setting up the environment using Azure CLI.

## Creating a subscription
Topaz doesn't create a subscription by default yet (check [this](https://github.com/TheCloudTheory/Topaz/issues/16) issue for more information) so you will need to create one before you start integrating it with Azure CLI. The simplest option is using `subscription create` command provided by Topaz CLI:
```bash
$ topaz subscription create --id 36a28ebb-9370-46d8-981c-84efe02048ae --name "sub-local"
```
The same can be achieved using ASP.NET Core extension or with a raw HTTP request:
```bash
curl --location 'https://localhost:8899/subscriptions/36a28ebb-9370-46d8-981c-84efe02048ae' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"subscriptionId":"36a28ebb-9370-46d8-981c-84efe02048ae",\
    "subscriptionName":"DEV-Local-Topaz"}'
```
With the subscription created you can proceed to the next step.

## Setting up new environment
Azure CLI can connect with different cloud environments if needed (like Azure Stack) by registering them explictly using a dedicated command. To keep things simple, Topaz follows the exact same pattern. All you need is to download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheCloudTheory/Topaz/refs/heads/main/cloud.json) file and run the following command:
```bash
$ az cloud register -n Topaz --cloud-config @"cloud.json"

Switched active cloud to 'Topaz'.
Use 'az login' to log in to this cloud.
Use 'az account set' to set the active subscription.
```

Now you can sign in using `az login` and start using Azure CLI commands as usual.
```bash
$ az login
A web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`.

[1] *  DEV-Local-Topaz      36a28ebb-9370-46d8-981c-84efe02048ae  Topaz Cloud Environment
```

## Changing the active environment
If you want to change the environment in Azure CLI, you can do that with `az cloud set` command:
```bash
$ az cloud set -n AzureCloud
```
You can change the environment anytime if needed. It won't affect the resources you created using Topaz (unless you're running it as a container with no volume attached).
